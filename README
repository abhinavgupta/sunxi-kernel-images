The repository contains two kernel versions:

1. 3.4.29 - Consists of the following features
Features: a. Support for user-controllable LEDs on the board 
          b. GPIO support for the expansion headers 
          c. ssh server 
          d. Fast boot due to minimal services 
          e. Linaro/Ubuntu Server 13.01 used as base 
          f. Serial console enabled 
          g. sunxi linux kernel 3.4.x 
          h. Text-mode framebuffer console 
          i. Kernel configured with maximal networking options
          j. Loads of USB device drivers and handy things


Issues    a. Ethernet MAC not initializing
          b. UVC video drivers buggy
          
          
2. 3.0.69 - Consists of the following features
Features: a. Support for user-controllable LEDs on the board 
          b. GPIO support for the expansion headers

          g. sunxi linux kernel 3.4.x 
          h. Text-mode framebuffer console 
          i. Kernel configured with maximal networking options
          j. Loads of USB device drivers and handy things
          k. Ethernet full duplex 100Mb/s 
          l. Solved the speed fluctuations on reboot
          m. SPI IRQ activated on certain GPIO
          n. 7 UARTs configured


Issues    a. UVC video drivers buggy



Note : To support auto login on boot, assuming the OS is a debain OS, perform the following edits 
       in the file /etc/inittabs,
       
       Go the following line:
       1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1
       
       and change it to:
       #1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1
       
       and add the following line below it:
       1:2345:respawn:/bin/login -f YOUR_USER_NAME tty1 </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1
       
       This will enable autologin only not startX
  

3. 3.0.69+ - Consists of the following features
Features: a. Support for user-controllable LEDs on the board 
          b. GPIO support for the expansion headers
